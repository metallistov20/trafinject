# In-Makefile to generate C-primitive <inject>
#
# 1. Ensure <cURL-devel> is installed on your system. If needed
# can be downloaded from here: http://curl.haxx.se/download.html,
# but better is to use platform package mnager (dpkg, apr-get, etc).
#
# 2. Provide flags -I<dir> and -L<dir> once installed
# into not default 'lib' and 'include' dirs of compiler.
